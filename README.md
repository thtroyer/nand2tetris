# nand2tetris
[nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) project.  This repo contains my solutions as I work through it.

## Repo structure
 - projects - This contains the nand2tetris project files from the course.  This is the directory I will work in and fill in my solutions here.
 - solutions - This will contain my finished solutions after I'm done working with them in the projects folder.  I'll just copy my solutions and not any of the test/boilerplate files.
